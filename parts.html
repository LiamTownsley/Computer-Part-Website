RAM has a very fast path to the computer's Central Processing Unit, or CPU, essentially the brain of the computer. Think of your hard drive as a filing cabinet where all your data is stored and the RAM is like your desk, where you put the stuff you're currently working on.</td>

SSDs replace mechanical hard disks by using flash-based memory, which is significantly faster. SSDs speed up computers significantly due to their low read-access times and fast throughputs. The benefits of Solid state drives, they deliver faster load times for games, applications, and movies, and because of the technology they use, SSDs are lighter and better able to withstand movement and droppage. In addition, solid state drives use less energy, allowing computers to run cooler.</td>
